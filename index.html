      <p> The Sun is the star at the center of our solar system. It is an almost perfect sphere of super-hot gases whose gravity holds the solar system together. The energy produced by the Sun is essential for life on Earth and is a driving force behind the Earth’s weather.
        <br> 
        <br>
        <br> 

        <b> Facts about the Sun</b><br>
        <br> 
The Sun is all the colors mixed together, this appears white to our eyes.
        <br> 
        <br> 
The Sun is made of 70% hydrogen and 28% helium.
        <br> 
        <br> 
The Sun is a main-sequence G2V star, also known as a yellow dwarf star.
        <br> 
        <br> 
The Sun is 109 times wider than the Earth and 330,000 times as massive.
        <br> 
        <br> 
The Sun’s surface area is 11,990 times that of the Earths.
        <br> 
        <br> 
The distance between the Earth and the Sun is called an Astronomical Unit (abbreviated as AU).
        <br> 
        <br> 
        <b>1.3 million Earths could fit inside the Sun.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The Sun contains 99.86% of the mass in the Solar System.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
The mass of the Sun is approximately 330,000 times greater than that of Earth.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The Sun is an almost perfect sphere.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
There is a 10-kilometre difference between the Sun’s polar and equatorial diameter. This means it is the closest thing to a perfect sphere that has been observed in nature.
        <br>
        <br>
When the Sun has burned all its Hydrogen, it will continue to burn helium for 130 million more years. During this time, it will expand to the point that it will engulf Mercury, Venus, and possibly the Earth. At this stage it will have become a red giant.
        <br>
        <br>
<b>The Sun will one day be about the size of Earth.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
After its red giant phase, the Sun will collapse. It will keep its enormous mass with the approximate volume of our planet. When this happens, it will have become a white dwarf.
  <br>
  <br>
<b>The temperature inside the Sun can reach 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius).</b>
        <br>
        <br>
Energy is generated at the Sun’s core, by nuclear fusion, as Hydrogen converts to Helium. Hot objects expand, the Sun would explode if it were not for its enormous gravitational force. The temperature on the surface of the Sun is closer to 5,600 degrees Celsius.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>Light from the Sun takes eight minutes to reach Earth.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The Sun travels at 136 miles (220 kilometers) per second.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
The Sun is 24,000-26,000 light years from the galactic center. It takes the Sun 225-250 million years to complete an orbit of the center of the Milky Way.
        <br>
        <br>
This is because the Earth travels on an elliptical orbit around the Sun. The distance between the Earth and the Sun is 93 million miles (149 million kilometers).
        <br>
        <br>
  <b>The Sun is middle-aged.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
At around 4.6 billion years old, the Sun has already burned off about half of its store of Hydrogen. It has enough left to continue to burn Hydrogen for approximately 5 billion years. The Sun is currently a type of star known as a Yellow Dwarf.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b>The Sun has a very strong magnetic field.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
Magnetic energy released by the Sun during magnetic storms causes solar flares. We see these as sunspots. In sunspots, the magnetic lines twist and they spin, much like a tornado would on Earth.
        <br>
        <br>
<b>The Sun generates solar wind.</b>
        <br>
        <br>
The wind is a stream of charged particles. This travels at approximately 450 kilometres per second through the solar system. Solar wind occurs when the magnetic field of the Sun extends into space.
  <br>
  <br>
 <b>Sol means sun and This is where the word “solar” comes from, which is used to describe things that are derived from, related to, or caused by the Sun, like solar power. </b>
